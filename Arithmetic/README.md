# Arithmetic
This contract provides a set of functions for performing basic arithmetic operations on integers.

## Functions
- addition(int _numX, int _numY)
This function takes two integers _numX and _numY as input and returns the result of _numX + _numY.

- subtraction(int _numX, int _numY)
This function takes two integers _numX and _numY as input and returns the result of _numX - _numY.

- multiplication(int _numX, int _numY)
This function takes two integers _numX and _numY as input and returns the result of _numX * _numY.

- division(int _numX, int _numY)
This function takes two integers _numX and _numY as input and returns the result of _numX / _numY. If _numY is 0, an error is thrown.

- modulo(int _numX, int _numY)
This function takes two integers _numX and _numY as input and returns the result of _numX % _numY.
